Code for the projects done during my internship at LightningChart. Mostly practical demonstrations for their Python Trader software, and two for their Python chart product. The articles them can be found from LightnigChart's blog. TODO add link here once they are published.
The data files are not included at the moment, due to fiule size limits.
